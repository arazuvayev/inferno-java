This folder contains some jvm tests.

These simple pieces of code try to check some basic jvm
and jcl features. They are currently using mkfiles as
tests platform, but may later use Inferno's itest.

Currently tests are defined in mkfile, in TESTS var.
Every test consists of runnable java class.

Useful commands:
	mk, or mk tests: compiles and runs all the tests
	mk test-%test name%: run some specific test
	mk clean: clean-up all binary and debug files
