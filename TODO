This project is intended to run Java 7 apps natively in inferno,
by converting class files to dis and linking them at runtime.

Currently working features:
	- not many of them really, see problem list below
	- although jvm runtime loader and linker is supposed to
	work with java 1.4 classes (there was no chance to get
	those sources, as java released only 1.5 ones and later)
	sources are needed to provide native part of the JCL

TODO:
	- reworkd j2d to support modern exception handling in dis
	- implement support for new bytecode instructions:
		- DONE - ldc, ldc2, ldcw_2, ldc2_w: those will accept
		more argument types, see http://docs.oracle.com/
		javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.10.1.9.ldc
		since class file version 49.0
		- invokedynamic, completely new since 49.0
	- prepare the pkg dir that would contain all the JCL classes
	from the OpenJDK (as they come with GPL license), compiled and
	translated into dis
	- implement proper makefiles to compile JCL and native classes
	- more to come later...

Current tasks:
	- correct exception handling in dis code
		- just translate the addresses and write them directly
		to dis 'handlers' section at the end
	- support for new const types (CONSTANT_MethodHandle,
	CONSTANT_MethodType, CONSTANT_InvokeDynamic):
		-DONE- internal structures (java.m)
		-DONE- loading from class files (loader.b)
		- verification (loader.b)
		- debug output (loader.b)
	- support for new instruction behaviuor
		- DONE - ldc, ldc_w (new argument types):
			- DONE - loading and verification (javadas.b)
			- DONE - simulation (simjvm.b)
			- DONE - translation (xlate.b)
			- DONE - runtime support (classloader.b) - NOT COMPLETELY TESTED
			- note: the ldc since 50.0 supports Class refs loading for
			classes, so we need a way to obtain that class from the loader
			and push it to the stack
		- invokedynamic
			- loading from class files
			- verification
			- translation
			- runtime support (?)

Unimplemented or not fully implemented native classes:
	- java/lang/Class - some reflection functions
	- sun/misc/Unsafe - currently completely unimplemented
	-
